A)
===========
Program that can produce a game of tic tac toe or rock paper scissors.

B)
==
The current state of software is able to be compiled and ran properly. It produces a gui for user to interact with. 

C)
==
The program opens up a GUI that offers a choice to play tic tac toe or rock paper scissors. In tic tac toe toe you have the choice to play against a human or the computer. Rock paper scissors offers the choice to play multiple games of rock paper scissors against the computer only.

D)
==
Make a more inviting GUI for the user. Add levels of difficulty for playing the computer in tic tac toe. Randomly assign who gets to go first on tic tac toe. Offer different themes for the games. Can go back to traditional form of rock paper scissors with the button names. Can potentially add a pictures to rock paper scissors to spice it up.
E)
==
README.md is up to date. Any potential changes that added in the future will definetly be updated accordingly.
F)
==
build.xml are also up to date. All targets are given descriptions and old legacy code is accounted for and removed.
G)
==
There is a variety of issues that can be combined to earn a total of 1000 points or more. The issues are clear and concise on what needs to be done to earn the points.
H)
==
Not yet added, but for record:
   * When prompt to enter name, we need to start with that highlighted so a user could immediately start typing    and the change can be made

I) 
==
I see plenty of organization in the .java files. Every java file is specific.For example, theres a "FirstPlayer.java", "PlayerName.java","GameGui.java". It makes it alot easier for us to navigate through the code and be able to correctly identiy whats doing what. Now for actual code, it might be a bit tricky to be understanding what's going on, but with the 10+ different .java files that are included, (all of which have a its own purpose, I trust that we will be able to navigate through fairly easily. After taking a random sample of .java files and looking through them, the methods have clear names and it is fairly easy to see what is going on.
J)
== 
there are no J-unit testing. running "ant compile" only compiles the code; I do not see any test cases.

Our chat with Christian
=======================
We plan to fix up alot of things that make the user experience alot cleaner. There arent any bugs, but rather alot of factors in the program that make it a little annoying to be playing. For example: a better algorithim to make tic tac toe a little more difficult, or more options for pictures (so it snot just centered around pokemon).
