1. This project contains 2 separate games: tic-tac-toe and rock-paper-scissors, in which there are only one default difficulty level for each game. The characters are Pokemons.

2. As a player, I can choose a Pokemon character. As a player, I can choose between tic-tac-toe and rock-paper-scissors. As a player, I can win or lose to the computer.

3. When it runs, a home screen (RunJava class) pops up that allows the user to choose between 2 games.

4. As a player, I can make my computer opponent easy or difficult. As a player, I can make sound effects when I click on a Pokemon or any buttons.

5. The current README.md needs more information about what happened in M16. The developer only described in one sentence what he/she added, and didn't make further comments on the new issues. On the contrary, the F15 notes to be be cut down shorter and more clear.

6. We don't think that there are targets that need descriptions or anything to be removed as of now.

7. The issues are a fair distribution among easy and hard fixes. Easy ones would be adding JLabel Titles, but hard ones would be integrating networking capabilities, increasing the Tic-Tac-Toe AI, and refactoring the code for better abstraction because currently, the game data and the UI are intertwined into one class.

9. The purpose of the classes and methods are extremely clear. Yes it's easy to understand. We would tell a person that's going to work on the code that this program invokes 2 games: Tic Tac Toe and Rock Paper Scissors, where players place their chosen Pokemon characters on the screen instead of X's or O's, rocks, papers, or scissors.RunGame.java is the class that will contain code on what happens when you run the entire program. Inside this class, each player has their own method, such as the method firstPlayer or secondPlayer. And in each player method is information about who their pokemon is, what color the background of their pokemon icon will be, and other GUI methods that render these images on screen. Other than RunGame.java, the other classes contain methods that keeps track of the moves made by each player, the winner, and the score.

10. The JUnit tests file was not launchable and hasn't been updated in 2 years.


The firstplayer and secondplayer methods have many statements that could be moved to a diffrent method. These statements set the font, background color, foreground color, output strings like "I Choose You!" that could ALL be moved into a Pokemon-focused class, not a player-focused class. Thus, these methods should be moved for better understanding.

Also, the same issue appears in secondPlayer method; however, this same code is implemented differently in this version, so we should choose one of those versions (or a better one) and put them in a separate class.

Overall, most of the code needs refactoring because they used alot of conditional statements rather than fully embrace the OO approach instead.
The code is not maintainable because if we add more players, or more options to the game, the conditons would fail.
