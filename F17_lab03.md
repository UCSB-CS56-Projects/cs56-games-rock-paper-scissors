a) This program allows you to play two simple game - either tic-tac-toe or rock-paper-scissors
b) As a user, I can choose to play rock-paper-scissors so that it leads me to a new page and let me select Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Charmander as rock, paper, and scissors, respectively, to play against the computer. 
As a user, If I pick tic-tac-toe so that I can use Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Charmander as X and O to play against either computer or another human player.
c) The software is able to run and it allows you to play either tic-tac-toe or rock-paper-scissors.
d) As a rock-paper-scissors, I need a scoreboard so that I can track how many time I win.
As a tic-tac-toe player, I need a higher difficult level ai so that it can be more challenging.
As a tic-tac-toe player, I need an option to change Pokemon so that I don’t have to restart the game to change it.
e) README.md needs more examples and a description of different versions of the games.
f) In build.xml, all targets have proper description. There is no need to remove old JWS stuff.
g. for this project we have totally 21 issues, which is enough for earning 1000 points. All of expectations are clearly stated, and most of them are plausible based on our current knowledge. Refactoring the code for better abstraction is worth 500 points, with some other smaller issues, it is easy to reach out 1000 points.
h. [issue in I Choose You Button](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-rock-paper-scissors/issues/55)
[issue in Rock-Paper-Scissor AI](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-rock-paper-scissors/issues/56 )
i. code is organized into 8 classes. The purpose of the classes and methods are very clear. The relations between each class are obvious, yet some methods in some classes are too nested with too much if else statements, which is hard to understand.
“computer, GameGUI, and TicTacToe classes are three main classes to work on. Computer class is the AI of the game, which is just some random generating method. It can be later modified to increase AI difficulties. GameGUI and TicTacToe can be optimized since most of the methods are nested and hard to understand. More comments to be written, and better ways to be implemented.”
j. there is no test coverage at all. No unit tests. If we were to expand test coverage, we would write some test to see the performance of AI. For other parts, tests should be started with tests about creating Pokémon which is the very first step for the game. We have to make sure the first step is correct, and build other tests step by step.
